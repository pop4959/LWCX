### Information
LWC is the longest-lived single block protection plugin, that protects both the blocks themselves and their contents. Originally designed in 2010 for locking chests (hence the name "Lightweight Chests"), it can be configured to lock any block.

Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/pop4959/LWCX/wiki) for important information about setting up and using the plugin.

### Contributing
Contributing to LWCX is encouraged, and very easy. Fork the repository, and build using maven. Simply make a pull request explaining your changes, and how they are a beneficial addition to the plugin. Travis will automatically build all pull requests to ensure that they build on OpenJDK 8.
