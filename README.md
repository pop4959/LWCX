LWC is the longest-lived single block protection plugin that protects both the block itself and contents of Chests, Furnaces, and Dispensers. It can also protect any other blocks, and by default will also protect Doors (Wooden + Iron), Signs and Trap Doors.
THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL BUILD.
Entity Locking Info:
- Entity locking is the same as block locking.
- Players can lock Armor Stands, Item frames, Paintings, Hopper and Chest minecarts, etc.
- Players cant steal items from Armor Stands or Item frames , unless they have permission to. (Same perm as the one that allows Mods or whoever to open chests, etc.)
- Projectiles cant break protected entities.
- Armor stands are still affected by gravity, So put something like Obsidian below it so other players cant move it down.
- You can unlock Armor Stands, but you need to break it and re-lock it.
- You need to UNLOCK the minecart to remove it.
- Lock your favorite squid! (It does work.)
- Mob locking. (ANY entity can be locked.)
- Locking horses wont prevent people from riding them (So be careful!)
- P.S.: Mob locking doesn't work very well....
