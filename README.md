### Project Information
This project is intended to be the (unofficial) continuation of the once extremely popular LWC plugin. If you currently use LWC, [please see this wiki page](https://github.com/Hidendra/LWC/wiki/Bukkit-1.8) for important information regarding versions above 1.8.

LWC is the longest-lived single block protection plugin that protects both the block itself and contents of chests, furnaces, and Dispensers. It can also protect any other blocks, and by default will also protect doors (wooden + iron), signs and trapdoors.

***THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL CONTINUATION OF THIS PROJECT.***

**Entity Locking Info:**
  - Entity locking functions the same as block locking.
  - Players can lock armor stands, item frames, paintings, hopper and chest minecarts, and many other entities.
  - Players cant steal items from armor stands or item frames, unless they have permission to. (Same permission as the one that allows moderators to bypass protections.)
  - Projectiles can't break protected entities.
  - Armor stands are still affected by gravity, be sure to put something such as obsidian below it so other players can't move it down.
  - You can unlock armor stands in the latest version.
  - You must unlock minecarts *first* to remove them. (`/cremove`)
  - Lock your favorite squid! (It does work.)
  - Mob locking. (ANY entity can be locked.)
  - Locking horses won't prevent people from riding them, be careful!
  - **Note:** Entity locking is *very* buggy, feel free to contribute and improve the code.
